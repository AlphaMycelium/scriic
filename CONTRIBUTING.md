# Contributing to Scriic

## Commit Messages

Scriic is released automatically every week using [Python Semantic Release][psr].
Therefore, we must follow the [Angular commit style guide][angular-commits] in
all commit messages.

The scope of your commit should be:

- A single command you are modifying (e.g. `SUB` or `DO`)
- `scriicsics` if you are making changes to the Scriicsics package

It is safe to leave the scope blank if you are changing many areas or
something not listed above, please use your common sense.
